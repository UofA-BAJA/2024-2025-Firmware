In the tests folder you can basically put whatever you want.
This is a place to screw aroudn and test stuff that you don't necessarily want
to be a part of the car, but you still need to practice getting it running.

Examples of what might go in here are test pyqt6 projects, simple arduino sketches,
platformIO projects, etc.
